The dataset contains PM2.5 of hourly averaged responses from sensors embedded in an Air Quality Device recorded by the US Embassy in Beijing from 2010 to 2014 (four year)..
## Information about city 

Beijing is the capital city of the People’s Republic of China and was formerly known as Peking. It is the world’s most populous city with an estimated population of over 21 million residents. The city is located in the northern part of China and covers an area of 16,500 square kilometres. In 2019 China was classed as the 11th dirtiest country in the world. The city of Beijing was ranked at 201.

Beijing air pollution is mainly caused by vehicle emissions and the burning of coal to produce electricity. Other factors that influence air quality in Beijing include the manufacturing industry and population growth. Of the twenty cities throughout the world with the worst air quality, 16 of them are located in China. Because of this, its Environmental Sustainability Index is ranked towards the bottom amongst countries worldwide.

An increase in personal wealth can also have an influence here. With surplus money at the end of each month, an individual is more able to buy a car. The number of motor vehicles in Beijing in 2017 was estimated at 5.5 million.

## Air pllution influence to health

Most common health issues are a sore throat and cough. Over the past decade, lung cancer rates have risen by over 60%. Other consequences of air pollution in Beijing include yellow skies, higher mortality rates, and cancelled flights due to low visibility levels.

Air pollution is very serious in many parts of the world. Nine out of ten people in the world breathe polluted air, and the death toll caused by air pollution reaches 7 million every year. Up to one third of deaths caused by stroke, lung cancer and heart disease are due to air pollution. Air pollution is everywhere. No matter where you live, you cannot escape. The fine pollutants in the air break through our body's defences, penetrate into our respiratory and circulatory systems and damage our lungs, heart and brain.

The pollutant that affects people the most is particulate matter, usually abbreviated as PM and used as a measure of air pollution. Although particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less (≤PM10) can penetrate and embed deep in the lungs, the ones that are more harmful to health are those with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (≤PM2.5). These particles are very small, only one 60th the diameter of a human hair.
